The following repository contains my writeup and code for an interrupted time-series analysis of voter turnout in Iowa and Delaware, where I estimated effects of two policy changes. 
This work was part of a bigger project on voter turnout, which I will add when the semester ends. 
The html file contains the writeup, while the QMD contains the code. 
Note I renamed the HTML to better correspond to its contents, though it is an exact copy of the original HTML output.
Thank you for viewing!
